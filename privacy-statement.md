            The watch face has to remember which color scheme (amber, green, blue) is in effect. Otherwise the setting would be forgotten all the time and have to be configured.

    <h5>Securing your data</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            The watch face does not encrypt the color selection or complication choices. These are stored locally only in a comparment allocated only for the watch face itself (not shared with other apps or watch faces).

<div class="section">
    <h5>Cross-border data transfers</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            The watch face does not transfer the color scheme selection or the complication configurations to anywhere, it only stores those locally.
            It can happen that some Wear OS system libraries could communicate certain information related to complications, but that's completely out of the jurisdiction of the watch face. Similarly, the complications themselves obviously may have to communicate, for example a weather complication needs to fetch weather data from a service. That's out of the jurisdiction of the watch face, the watch only knows what type of complication is selected and which position it is, and the complication is a black box for the watch face in any other way.

            This document was created using a Contractology template available at <a href="http://www.freenetlaw.com/">http://www.freenetlaw.com</a>.
            Csaba Consulting customized that template to reflect the particular application instead of a website,
            and transformed it into HTML5/markdown format. The modified source is available on
